Parking was a breezy to find they validate. The only thing that I to complain is the cold bathroom!

The staff, while friendly are very unprofessional. The room smelled like stale whatever and bug spray. They had the heat set to a  roasting 80+ degrees. The window in the room opened up to a filthy shaft of some sort. The tile in the bathroom needs cleaned ASAP the scum and mildew turned it black...ugh! ...so these were the mildly annoying issues. What truly disgusted me, made me just never ever want to return...was housekeeping... waking us up on a Saturday morning at 9 am to clean the room I just checked into the night before. 9 am on a Saturday...When we told them we were still asleep they proceeded to knock hourly until we  went out! What are you people doing? This was a deplorable \"hotel\" please never stay here!',\n",

       "    'text': \"Great location, if you have an oversized vehicle parking can be a hassle. Room could definitely have been cleaner but it wasn't terrible and smelled fine. Didn't see any bugs and I always look. Day staff was very friendly, late night staff should find sonething else to do. When it comes down to it, I really enjoyed the hotel and Philly. The hotel is old and has character, just like the city. I liked the narrow stairs and halls. Kind of connects you to the past, while you wonder who has walked those halls before. I would definitely stay here again if I didn't have an oversized vehicle. I did mail two packages there and both came up missing never to be found.\",\n",

       "    'text': \"The hotel's location can't be beat. it is near great restaurants, night life, and the convention center. It is in a refurbished old mansion, so the proportions are odd and frankly very small. They have spent money in renovating and making it pleasant to stay in. However there are a couple of points I want to make for future guests at this hotel:\\n\\n1) The rooms are very small. My room didn't have a closet to hang clothes in (despite having a fridge and a microwave, weird). I had to drape my suits over a chair to store them. I also didn't have a phone in my room so I had to go talk to the front desk for any problems\\n\\n2) The walls are so thin as to practically not be there. I was kept awake by my next door neighbor's whispered phone conversations. He was a nice guy it seems, really loves his kids.\\n\\n3) My bathroom was across the hall and required my door key to get into. And it was very very small. I had to sit sideways on the toilet with my knees in the shower because it was so small. The bathroom situation actually didn't bother me too much because I don't mind walking across a hall in a towel. If I were a woman or more modest it might have been an issue\\n\\n4) No air control in the room. When I got to my room it was almost 90 degrees and I searched to no avail for at least a window unit. Fortunately the people at the front desk (remember I had to walk down because no phone) were very nice and when I came back from dinner the entire floor felt much cooler.\\n\\nOverall I will probably stay here again just because of the price and location. But now I know to go in with a mindset that it will be kind of like camping in a tent in the inner city Philadelphia.\",\n",
