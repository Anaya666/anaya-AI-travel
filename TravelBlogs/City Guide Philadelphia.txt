So, whether you‚Äôre a history buff, a foodie on a quest for the ultimate hoagie, or just someone looking for a city with a spirit as big as its sports fandom, Philly‚Äôs got a spot for you in its heart.


MUST-SEES | What You Cannot Miss
LIBERTY BELL + INDEPENDENCE HALL

Two of America‚Äôs national treasures sit directly across from one another in Philadelphia‚Äôs Old City neighborhood. The Liberty Bell was minted 1751 to mark the 50-year anniversary of the creation of Pennsylvania‚Äôs original founding charter. Independence Hall is the site where two of the USA‚Äôs most important documents, the Declaration of Independence and The Constitution were signed. (101 S Independence Mall W, Philadelphia, PA 19106)
Did you know? When William Penn was mapping out the city, he created a grid that was based around five squares which are known as Rittenhouse, Washington, Logan, Franklin, and City Hall. These major squares are still major city landmarks.
 You can see the Liberty Bell for free and the hall includes an exhibit of the bell‚Äôs history
CITY HALL

The tallest municipal building in the USA, Philadelphia‚Äôs City Hall is also home to one of Philly‚Äôs most iconic pieces of art: the 37-foot-tall statue of city founder William Penn. Most people don‚Äôt know that you can actually take a tower tour of City Hall, offering rare 365-degree views of the city right under the bronze feet of iconic Billy Penn. (1400 John F Kennedy Blvd, Philadelphia, PA 19107)
Don‚Äôt skip out on‚Ä¶¬† Dilworth Park is located at the western courtyard in front of City Hall. In the summer, take some laps around the outdoor retro roller skating rink or bring your kids to the public splash yard that delivers free summertime fun. There are also a ton of art market pop-ups throughout the year.

JFK PLAZA (LOVE PARK)

Across the street from Dilworth Park is JFK Plaza, more commonly known as Love Park, featuring the famous LOVE typographic sculpture by artist Robert Indiana. While it isn‚Äôt the original LOVE statue, it certainly is the most famous. During Valentine‚Äôs Day, the mayor officiates weddings at the statue. Visiting during the holidays? Do not miss out on the Christmas Village at LOVE Park, which as close as a European Market as you can get on the east coast. (Arch St, Philadelphia, PA 19102)
MAGIC GARDENS

South Philly‚Äôs best tourist attraction is a mosaic labyrinth built completely by hand by local folk artist, Isaiah Zagar. The unique mixed media sculpture garden is a visionary masterpiece and well-worth the $25 entrance fee. You must reserve a spot in advance. There are free guided tours every Saturday morning. (1020 South St, Philadelphia, PA 19147)
Tip: If you like public art and mural work, take a Mural Arts Tour around one of Philadelphia‚Äôs many neighborhoods.

FAIRMOUNT PARK

An urban oasis with the best views of the Philadelphia skyline and its tranquil waterways frequented by runners, pedestrians, and cyclists alike. With over 2,000 acres of public recreational space, Fairmount Park is prime spot for picnickers enjoying a sunny day by the river. Notable landmarks include the iconic Boathouse Row twinkling along the Schuylkill River, and the enchanting and often overlooked Shofuso Japanese House and Garden, ranked one of the best Japanese gardens in the country. (Reservoir Dr, Philadelphia, PA 19119)
PHILADELPHIA MUSEUM OF ART + ROCKY STEPS

Take a page out of Rocky Balboa‚Äôs training routine playbook. A triumphant sprint up the Museum of Art‚Äôs grand staircase is an unofficial rite of passage in Philadelphia but running is optional.Just don‚Äôt skip out on entering the Museum of Art , especially for Impressionist paintings by Van Gogh and Renoir, and a full-scale Buddhist temple on the third floor. It‚Äôs ‚Äúpay-as-you-wish‚Äù every Friday night from 5 to 8:45 pm. (2600 Benjamin Franklin Pkwy, Philadelphia, PA 19130)
 Find this mural at the beginning of the Rocky Steps aka the Philadelphia Museum of Art grand staircase
EASTERN STATE PENITENTIARY

The crumbling cells of one of the world‚Äôs most storied prisons continues to appeal to history enthusiasts and ‚Äúdark tourism‚Äù fans, fascinated by the grim stories of infamous prisoners like ‚ÄúScarface‚Äù Al Capone, a notable gangster, and all the prisoners who went mad in this gothic correctional facility. (2027 Fairmount Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19130)
Tip: The prison transforms into a haunted house complex come Halloween and offers a one-of-a-kind twilight tour in the summertime complete with a beer garden and radio broadcasts from incarcerated people in a functioning Colorado prison.

FOOD FINDS | What To Eat
READING TERMINAL MARKET

Reading Terminal Market is one of the USA‚Äôs most popular public markets and it‚Äôs been operating since 1893. 80+ vendors peddle gastronomic delights daily from Georgian cheeseboats to aromatic Thai-style coconut salmon curries, and even decadent Amish baked goods and Moroccan kitchenware. Rain or shine, this is spot where locals rub shoulders with thousands of visitors weekly for their regular order. Here are my personal favorite spots to eat, especially for lunch:
üìçLittle Thai Market ‚Äì Thai
üìçSaami Somi ‚Äì Georgian
üìçFox & Sons ‚Äì Gluten-Free American State Fair Foods
üìçBeiler‚Äôs Doughnuts ‚Äì Baked Goods
Neighborhood: Center City | 1136 Arch St, Philadelphia, PA 19107
 The quieter hours are typically before 10 am and after 2 pm
SOUTH PHILLY BARBACOA

Don‚Äôt let the strange operating hours deter you from visiting this taqueria hidden in the Italian Market. The humble taco joint from critically-acclaimed chef and activist Cristina Mart√≠nez is a culinary refuge for Mexican homecooking and community. Slow-cooked, tender meats are served on freshly made corn tortillas with flavorful consomm√© broth. The spot is cash only with a constant line on weekends, but don‚Äôt worry, it goes quickly.
Neighborhood: Italian Market | 1134 S 9th St, Philadelphia, PA 19147
MIDDLE CHILD CLUBHOUSE

The clubhouse elevates the classic Philadelphia ‚Äúluncheonette‚Äù concept, where you order at the counter, no reservations required. Featuring neon signage and felt letterboards complimented by the city‚Äôs favorite color: Kelly Green, its a popular breakfast hangout with great vibes and award-winning breakfast sandwiches. My go-to order is the fully vegan ‚ÄúPhoagie‚Äù sandwich, a club inspired by a bowl of Vietnamese pho noodle soup.
Neighborhood: Fishtown | 1232 N Front St, Philadelphia, PA 19122

TERAKAWA RAMEN

Terakawa serves Kyushu-style ramen, with pork bone broth simmered for at least two days and two types of fresh ramen noodles. Their ramen is fantastic (and I say this as a non-ramen love), but my go-to is the Gyu Don donburi, which is an umami explosion made up of savory-sweet beef slices garnished with pickled onions and a seasoned egg. There are only 30 seats so it gets packed very quickly. Go during the day for no lines.
Neighborhood: Chinatown | 204 N 9th St, Philadelphia, PA 19107

C√ÄPH√ä ROASTERS

My obsession with coffee culture in the city began with C√†ph√™ Roasters, Philadelphia‚Äôs first and only Vietnamese roastery. This spot is insanely trendy and a favorite co-working spots thanks to its homey, living room-like atmosphere. Here, you get a real taste of the Vietnamese flavors with specialty beverages like egg coffee and B·∫°c X·ªâu (Saigon-style coffee). The menu is a bit on the pricier side but their banh mi sandwiches are phenomenal and they have a seasonal pumpkin porridge that has a cult following on social media.
Neighborhood: Kensington | 3400 J St G1, Philadelphia, PA 19134

FEDERAL DONUTS

Local celeb chef Michael Solomonov of Zahav and Goldie fame banded together with four other friends to dream up a one-stop shop for donuts, fried chicken, and coffee. First-class comfort food is spiced with baharat, an addictive Middle Eastern spice blend. Their inventively ‚ÄúFancy‚Äù iced cake donuts are really out-of-this-world when it comes to originality. And I can‚Äôt forget their fried chicken sandwich, which is my FAVORITE in the city. The secret: the baharat is also in the fried chicken batter.
Neighborhood: Fairmount, Northern Liberties, Logan Square, Center City, Queen Village
 You can also order ‚ÄúHot Fresh‚Äù donuts which are freshly fried donuts dipped in flavored sugars
JOE‚ÄôS STEAK & SODA SHOP

Philadelphians take their cheesesteaks so seriously that there is a holiday observance dedicated to the city‚Äôs namesake sandwich (March 24) and even an annual cheesesteak bracket run by the local newspaper. You‚Äôll hear Pat‚Äôs (the original shop), Geno‚Äôs, and even Angelo‚Äôs (my second favorite), but for visitors, I really like taking them to Joe‚Äôs Steaks. The diner-esque restaurant is ‚ÄúAll American‚Äù, and they even have walk-up window so you can take their 73-year-old cheesesteak recipe to-go.
Neighborhood: Fishtown | 1 W Girard Ave, Philadelphia, PA 19125
ROWHOME COFFEE

Came for the coffee, stayed for the soft pretzels. Rowhome has a unique take on the city‚Äôs favorite handheld snack. You can order their pretzels one of two ways: as a breakfast item with cream cheese OR as a heaping sandwich you can order with sage sausage, roast beef, and even the local processed meat, Taylor Pork Roll. The sandwiches are extremely rich and hefty, so cut the richness with one of their many beverage offerings.
Neighborhood: Rittenhouse | 2536 Pine St, Philadelphia, PA 19103

KALAYA
Buzzworthy Kalaya enchants with Southern Thai cuisine unfamiliar to Western palates, featuring dishes with intense spice levels and a hint of pageantry on every plate. Chef-owner and James Bear Award winner Chutatip ‚ÄúNok‚Äù Suntaranon is known for her lavender-tinged ‚ÄúShaw Muang‚Äù dumplings and a fried branzino framed by a bounty of fresh herbs. The aesthetic is romantic tropics, completely with a trio of 14-foot palm trees in the middle of the vaulted restaurant.
Neighborhood: Fishtown | 4 W Palmer St, Philadelphia, PA 19125
HONEYSUCKLE PROVISIONS

If you find yourself in West Philly, make a beeline for this Afrocentric grocery. At Honeysuckle Provisions, every dish weaves together tradition and ingredients from Black farmers and producers to create nourishing takeaways. Picture this: hot pockets packed with smoky collard greens. Haitian fried pork smothered in brie. Scrapple made out of black eyed peas. Soul food at its finest.
Neighborhood: West Philly | 310 S 48th St, Philadelphia, PA 19143
BOK BAR

Bok Bar is Philly‚Äôs favorite seasonal bar and the ultimate rooftop hangout, the crown jewel of the iconic Bok Building in South Philly. The former Bok school was repurposed into a makerspace and people flock to Bok Bar for its killer views, chill vibes, and the best sunset in the city hands down. One thing I love about Bok Bar is they have a rotation of food partners so every month, you get a taste of the city‚Äôs hottest offerings like Tabachoy, Puyero, and even Kalaya!
Neighborhood: South Philly |¬† 800 Mifflin St, Philadelphia, PA 19148
Tip: Seats are hard to come by so unless you want to be standing all night long, come 1.5 hours before sunset and travel via ride share since parking is pretty tough in this neighborhood, especially on the weekends.

GETTING AROUND | Navigate With Ease

Ride share is the easiest way to get around the city, but if you want to cover more ground, I would highly suggest biking. Biking around the city is one of my favorite pastimes. It‚Äôs the easiest way to beat city traffic thanks designated bike lanes. Warning: driving in the city lawless so I recommend that you bike defensively and with caution. Here is a full roundup of transportation options:

‚Üí SEPTA (Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority): Utilize Philadelphia‚Äôs extensive public transit system, including buses, trolleys, and trains, for convenient and affordable travel around the city, and even to nearby suburbs like Villanova, Bryn Mawr, and King of Prussia.
‚Üí Biking: Explore Philadelphia‚Äôs bike-friendly streets using the city‚Äôs bike-sharing program, Indego, to pedal your way to popular attractions. The e-bikes are extremely fast but are 2x more expensive than the manual bikes.
‚Üí Walking: Experience the charm of Philadelphia up close by walking through its diverse neighborhoods and iconic landmarks. Walking is extremely advised in neighborhoods like Old City, Italian Market, and Passyunk, where parking is hard to come by.
‚Üí Ridesharing: The most convenient was to see the city is using ridesharing services like Uber and Lyft, but bear in mind that surge charging happens during peak commute hours. I would use rideshare to and from the airports as the Philadelphia Airport is only located 20 minutes from Center City.
‚Üí Hop On/Hop Off Bus: The double decker buses tend to stay in the Old City area where all the historic American attractions are. You could easily walk it but on poor weather days, this is the route to go.
