Food & Drink in Philadelphia
There should be a championship event just for Philadelphia’s food.
Chefs choose Philadelphia for their passion projects; it’s 
where they can run their (usually small) restaurants and 
fully commit to their vision. As such, there’s an incredible 
array of good food to eat here, and there’s a story behind 
every dish.

What makes up Philly’s diverse dining scene? Street food, 
300-plus bring-your-own-bottle (BYOB) restaurants, sidewalk 
seating reminiscent of European cities, bars with great food,
 craft pizza spots, vegetarian and vegan eateries 
  (that aren’t just for vegetarians and vegans) and the 
 storied Reading Terminal Market and Italian Market.
